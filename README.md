Fluorescent based monte carlo simulation code written by Refet Ali YALCIN (https://github.com/refetaliyalcin/monte-carlo-rte-fluorescent-medium) is modified for a double layer coating where top layer is fluorescent coating and bottom layer is scattering/absorbing random media.
Here, main_double_layer.m will take inputs for layer 1 and layer 2 to calculate reflectivity, transmissivity and absorptivity fluxes. pre_process_double_layer.m will calculate inputs for monte carlo code. monte_carlo_double_layer.m will run monte carlo simulation for double layer. The other files/functions to run the code is same as what is used in original code written for a single layer fluorescent coating and thus can be downloaded from https://github.com/refetaliyalcin/monte-carlo-rte-fluorescent-medium.
